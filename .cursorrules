# EstimateCalc Project Rules

## Project Overview
EstimateCalc is a professional web calculator for estimating development costs and timelines for web and mobile projects. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technology Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- jsPDF for PDF export
- React Icons

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer TypeScript interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use meaningful variable and function names in English or Ukrainian
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Use Tailwind utility classes, avoid inline styles

## File Structure
- `/app` - Next.js pages and layouts
- `/components` - Reusable React components
- `/store` - Zustand state management
- `/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/data` - Static data and constants
- `/utils` - Utility functions

## State Management
- Use Zustand for global state
- Persist calculator state in localStorage
- Calculate costs dynamically based on user input

## Components
- Step components for each calculator stage
- Each step should be self-contained
- Use the calculator store for state updates

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Custom styles in globals.css
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Consistent color scheme (primary-600 for main actions)

## Features to Maintain
1. Team configuration with roles and rates
2. Design complexity estimation
3. Feature selection with time estimates
4. Tech stack selection with multipliers
5. Testing and QA configuration
6. Additional costs (support, documentation, buffer)
7. Detailed cost breakdown
8. PDF export functionality
9. Save/load estimates

## Best Practices
- Validate user input
- Provide helpful error messages
- Keep calculations transparent
- Allow customization of estimates
- Make UI intuitive and user-friendly
